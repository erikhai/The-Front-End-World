# Project 1

## What is this project about?
This project is about learning how to create an interactive sign up page with animations for signing in or creating an account. 
I learn how to create this project through the following tutorial:

## What did I learn from this?
1. Animated cursors: I had no idea that I could use css to utilise custom cursors
2. Properly understanding the difference between id and class. A class is used when we want to apply a style or behaviour to multiple elements while id is used when we want to uniquely identify a specific element on the page.
